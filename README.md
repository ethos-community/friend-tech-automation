## Prerequisites

Make sure to install Node.js. You can install it from the [official site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current).

**Recommended**: install [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) and then run:

```shell
nvm install # Installs the required version (latest LTS v20).
nvm use # Activates the installed version
```

## Setup

Setup is easy. Just run `npm run setup`. This will make sure you have the latest version of the CLI, install all required dependencies and validate the setup.

Once it's done, you can use `fta` CLI which is globally installed for you.

## Usage

You can run `fta --help` to see the list of the commands.
